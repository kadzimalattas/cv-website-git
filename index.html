      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="My Photo" title="Hi, I'm Kadzim!">
     <p>
  I am Syed Muhammad Kadzim Alattas, a highly motivated and passionate first-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology (Hons) at Universiti Teknologi Petronas. My current focus is on web development, particularly front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I believe that technology should serve people by making tasks easier and experiences more enjoyable. This belief drives me to build user-friendly, accessible, and visually appealing web interfaces. I enjoy learning new tools and frameworks and take pride in writing clean, well-structured code. Outside of academics, I am also interested in design thinking, digital transformation, and problem-solving through technology.
